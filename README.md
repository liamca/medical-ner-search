The goal of this project is to show how to leverage [Apache cTAKES](http://ctakes.apache.org/) along with [Azure Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/search/) to build an effective document search application.  

## What is Apache CTakes
cTAKES stands for clinical text analytics and knowledge extraction and is a very effective method of extracting various medical based entities (named entity extraction) from a corpus of text.  For example it can identify disease or anatomical terms mentioned within the text.  It has been trained using dataources such as UMLS (snomed).
